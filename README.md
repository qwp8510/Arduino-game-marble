# Description
It's a prevalent game in Taiwain nightmarket.It's my childhood so I wanna make one by my own.All of tools are handy,and code is easier for beginner.It's just elementary,when you Compare with other professional Arduino project .Yet I think you'll get more than you think, when you do a project by your own.How to debug 、cascade circuits and how to make your function explicit.Here is a sample I made.Not a masterpiece but I like it.

Figure 4. I thought ciruits is a difficult part.It looks so complicated,but when you try to figure out, that is easy basic on it.
